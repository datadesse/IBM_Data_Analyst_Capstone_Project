### Peer-Graded Assignment_ Building a dashboard screenshot from my IBM Cognos account 

I was unable to generate Cognos dashboard link due to my IBM account issues. Alternatively I created similar charts using Python on Jupyter Notebook and Dashboards using Tableau Public .

#### For Dashboards I created using Tableau Public please see the following links:

#### About the database:
The actual data set used for Data Wrangling has around 90,000 responses but only around 1/10th of the original data set (randomised) is used for this exercise. Therefore, any conclusions drawn here may not reflect the real world scenario.
